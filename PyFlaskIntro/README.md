# PyFlaskIntro
Flask intro course from PluralSight by Reindert-Jan Ekker:
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/flask-micro-framework-introduction

Flask site kickstarted with http://www.initializr.com/

## Custom Form validation
It seems some browser are not nice with the URLField in HTML, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52085511/flask-wtf-validate-method-shouldnt-override-other-validations

## Cannot complete
I cannot complete module 5; the persistance.
As far as I can tell, I am following the instructions correctly, but I cannot load the db object from models.py -- maybe because of changes introduced in the 5 years since the course was made?
I will leave it here and look at the newer Mega-Flask tutorial instead.

# Future reading
The Mega-Flask tutorial by Miguel Grintberg looks like a good place to go; as I lack knowledge of transposing HTML (i.e. CSS).
There seems to be some CSS in there, but may end up going into Bootstrap instead.
Anyways, I think I'd better do that afterwards.
