# Notes
These are my notes from a [Flask example tutorial](https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup) from Real Python.  
Hopefully this can also become a Flask boilerplate/template later.

## Local PostgreSQL DB
Connect with: ```psql -U postgres``` and add the password to login, then: ```create database <name>;``` to create a new DB. Quit with `\q`.
